It can be viewed at docs.terria.io .","title":"Home"},{"location":"getting-started/","text":"The easiest way to get started with TerriaJS is to use TerriaMap . TerriaMap is a full-featured application built on TerriaJS, ready to be customized with your own branding and catalog. It is also a great starting point for more in-depth customization. This guide explains how to build and run TerriaMap locally. See Deploying to learn how to deploy it for use by others. You may also be interested in how to make your own map without writing any code . Quick Start If you've done this sort of thing before, you'll find it easy to clone and build TerriaMap with these quick instructions: git clone https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap.git cd TerriaMap npm install && npm run gulp && npm start # Open at http://localhost:3001 If you run into trouble or want more explanation, read on. Prerequisites TerriaJS can be built and run on almost any macOS, Linux, or Windows system. The following are required to build TerriaJS: The Bash command shell. On macOS or Linux you almost certainly already have this. On Windows, you can easily get it by installing Git for Windows . In the instructions below, we assume you're using a Bash command prompt. Node.js v8.0 or later. v10.x is also known to work. You can check your node version by running node --version on the command-line. npm v6.0 or later. npm is usually installed automatically alongside the above. You can check your npm version by running npm --version . The following components are optional: GDAL - Used for the conversion service that transforms Esri Shapefiles and other more obscure formats into GeoJSON for display in TerriaJS. This is not required for formats that TerriaJS supports directly, including KML, GeoJSON, etc. Cloning TerriaMap The latest version of TerriaMap is on GitHub , and the preferred way to get it is by using git : git clone https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap.git cd TerriaMap If you're unable to use git, you can also download a ZIP file and extract it somewhere on your system. We recommend using git, though, because it makes it much easier to update to later versions in the future. Installing Dependencies All of the dependencies required to build and run TerriaMap, other than the prerequisites listed above, are installed using npm : npm install The dependencies are installed in the node_modules subdirectory. No global changes are made to your system. Building TerriaMap Do a standard build of TerriaMap with: npm run gulp Or, you can create a minified release build with: npm run gulp release To watch for changes and automatically do an incremental build when any are detected, use: npm run gulp watch npm run gulp simply runs gulp , so you can use that directly if you prefer (run npm install -g gulp to install it globally). The full set of gulp tasks can be found on the Development Environment page. Running TerriaMap TerriaMap includes a simple Node.js-based web server, called terriajs-server . To start it, run: npm start Then, open a web browser on http://localhost:3001 to use TerriaMap. Keeping up with Updates If you're building an application by using TerriaMap as a starting point, you will want to keep in sync as TerriaMap is improved and updated to use new versions of TerriaJS. Forking the TerriaMap repo and using git to keep it in sync is outside the scope of this document, but GitHub has a nice explanation . After pulling new changes, you will need to run npm install again to pick up any changed dependencies and then build TerriaMap. If you have problems building or running, it is sometimes helpful to remove and reinstall the dependencies from npm: rm -rf node_modules npm install Prettier Prettier is used to format this codebase. If you've forked TerriaMap prior to prettier being applied, merging will be a hassle. Here's how to do it (relatively) painlessly: Create a new branch for your merge: git checkout -b whatever-merge If you haven't already installed npm-merge-driver , add it to your local git config via npx npm-merge-driver install . Merge the last commit before prettier into your branch: git merge pre-prettier . Resolve any conflicts as usual. If utilising yarn, it will resolve any yarn-lock.json conflicts automatically with another yarn install Commit the merge above. Merge the commit that ran prettier on all the source files into your branch. This is likely to cause heaps of conflicts, but because you've already merged the last commit before prettier, and because the prettier commit only changes formatting, you can safely accept your version any time there is a conflict. git merge post-prettier --strategy=ours --no-commit Run prettier on the result of the merge before committing it: npm run prettier Commit the merged result. Merge master into your branch in order to pick up any changes in master that happened after the prettiergeddon: git merge origin/master . Resolve any conflicts as normal. Commit and push your branch. Open a pull request of your merge branch into the original one. It should merge cleanly. If you're merging a branch-that-has-already-followed-this-procedure into your branch, you can follow the procedure above except that you need to use different commits instead of pre-prettier and post-prettier . Look at the commits in the source branch and you should see two that look like this: Use the commit hash of the commit that merged pre-prettier in place of pre-prettier above. Use the commit hash of the commit that merged post-prettier in place of post-prettier above. Having trouble? Drop by the TerriaJS gitter or forum and we'll be happy to help!

Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected.

If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning. Section 2 -- Scope. a. License grant. 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a) (4) never produces Adapted Material. 5. Downstream recipients. a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). b. Other rights. 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. Section 3 -- License Conditions. Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. a. Attribution. 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. 4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 -- Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 -- Interpretation. a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority. ======================================================================= Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

License Grants and Conditions 2.1. Grants Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license: a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version. 2.2. Effective Date The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution. 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor: a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party\u2019s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions. This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4). 2.4. Subsequent Licenses No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3). 2.5. Representation Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License. 2.6. Fair Use This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents. 2.7. Conditions Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1. Responsibilities 3.1. Distribution of Source Form All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients\u2019 rights in the Source Code Form. 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then: a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients\u2019 rights in the Source Code Form under this License. 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s). 3.4. Notices You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies. 3.5. Application of Additional Terms You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. Termination 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice. 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate. 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination. Disclaimer of Warranty Covered Software is provided under this License on an \u201cas is\u201d basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer. Limitation of Liability Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party\u2019s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You. Litigation Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party\u2019s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims. Miscellaneous This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor. Versions of the License 10.1. New Versions Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 10.2. Effect of New Versions You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward. 10.3. Modified Versions If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License). 10.4.

Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an \"as-is\" basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible. Using Creative Commons Public Licenses Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses. Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC- licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations for the public: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees ======================================================================= Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions. Section 1 -- Definitions. a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning. Section 2 -- Scope. a. License grant. 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a) (4) never produces Adapted Material. 5. Downstream recipients. a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). b. Other rights. 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. Section 3 -- License Conditions. Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. a. Attribution. 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. 4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 -- Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 -- Interpretation. a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority. ======================================================================= Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions: (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Before beginning, it is very important to understand Cross-Origin Resource Sharing . Web browsers impose restrictions on how we're allowed to access data across hosts (e.g. accessing data on data.gov.au from a web site running at nationalmap.gov.au ). Understanding these issues will avoid a lot of frustration while trying to add your data to a TerriaJS application. TerriaJS can interface with three broad types if data: Catalog Group : A group (folder) of items. Different group types allow the contents to be manually specified or to be automatically determined by querying various types of server. TerriaJS can use many different types of servers to populate a group, including CKAN, CSW, WMS, and more. For example, if you define a catalog group that points at a Web Map Service (WMS) server, TerriaJS will query the WMS GetCapabilities when the group is opened and fill the group with all of the layers advertised by the WMS server. Catalog Item : Actual geospatial or chart data from a file or service, in various formats. TerriaJS supports WMS, KML, GeoJSON, ArcGIS MapServer, and many more files and services as catalog items. Catalog Function : A parameterized service, such as a Web Processing Service (WPS). The user supplies the parameters and gets back some result.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"connecting-to-data/catalog-functions/","text":"A Catalog Function is a parameterized service where the user supplies the parameters and gets back some result.

This \"whitelist\" authorizes the proxy to work with those servers. Failing to do this may result in an error like this: ...the server does not support CORS. If this is your server, verify that CORS is enabled and enable it if it is not. If you do not control the server, please contact the administrator of the server and ask them to enable CORS. Or ... ask us to add this server to the list of non-CORS-supporting servers that may be proxied. Next, you should add servers that do support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to the corsDomains list in your initialization file . Servers in this list are contacted directly instead of going through the proxy... except: in Internet Explorer 9 if an HTTPS web page is accessing an HTTP server (this way we avoid a mixed content warning from the browser). If your server does not support CORS, then you still need to add it to the allowProxyFor whitelist, but do not add it to the corsDomains list. It will then be proxied. Sometimes we deliberately exclude CORS-supporting servers from the corsDomains list; the proxy caches its data, so we leverage its caching to improve performance. In both lists, a server name foo.org will be interpreted as *.foo.org . The port must match exactly. It's not very smart, so if you specify port 80 that won't match a server without a port specified, and vice-versa. The downside to a permissive whitelist is that you'll proxy for more servers, and people could use your proxy to make their (malicious?) traffic look like it's coming from your server instead of from theirs. More Detailed Explanation As a general rule, web browsers do not allow web sites running on one host (e.g. nationalmap.gov.au ) from accessing data running on another host (e.g. data.gov.au ) unless the data server ( data.gov.au in our example) explicitly enables a feature called Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) by including a special HTTP header in its response. Unfortunately, many servers still do not support CORS. If you control the server you're trying to access data on, enabling CORS is almost certainly a good idea, and you can read more about how to do it at enable-cors.org . TerriaJS has a trick to allow it to access data from a server even if that server doesn't support CORS: it uses a proxy server built into terriajs-server , which is included with TerriaMap. The idea is simple: we avoid the need for cross-origin support from servers by running a proxy on the same host that runs our app. That proxy can make requests to other servers on our application's behalf. This works because cross-origin restrictions are a security feature of web browsers, not web servers. The proxy makes it look to the browser like the data comes from the same origin. There's nothing dodgy about this. The risks that browsers are defending against by imposing cross-origin restrictions are not present in this scenario. However, by running a proxy server, our TerriaMap server potentially opens itself up to risks. We don't want people to be able to bounce arbitrary requests through our proxy, because that could be used to make (malicious?) traffic look like it is coming from your server instead of from the real source. This is why terriajs-server uses a whitelist of servers that it is willing to proxy for. The allowProxyFor property in devserverconfig.json specifies the whitelist. If the server is asked to proxy for any server not in the whitelist, the request will be rejected.","title":"Cross-Origin Resource Sharing"},{"location":"connecting-to-data/cross-origin-resource-sharing/#more-detailed-explanation","text":"As a general rule, web browsers do not allow web sites running on one host (e.g. nationalmap.gov.au ) from accessing data running on another host (e.g. data.gov.au ) unless the data server ( data.gov.au in our example) explicitly enables a feature called Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) by including a special HTTP header in its response.

Default false. zoomOnEnable A value indicating whether the map will automatically zoom to this catalog item when it is enabled. Note that within a single init source: Catalog items with both isEnabled and zoomOnEnable set to true will override the top-level initialCamera property. If multiple catalog items have both isEnabled and zoomOnEnable set to true, it is undefined which one will affect the camera. In the case of multiple init sources, however, the camera will reflect whatever happens in the last init source, whether it is a result of a zoomOnEnable or an initialCamera ,","title":"Carto Map (item)"},{"location":"connecting-to-data/catalog-type-details/carto/#initialization-file-properties","text":"\"type\": \"carto\" _nameInCatalog The name of the item to show in the catalog, if different from name .

If true, no part of the dataset will be displayed outside the rectangle. This property is true by default, leading to better performance and avoiding tile request errors that might occur when requesting tiles outside the server-specified rectangle. However, it may also cause features to be cut off in some cases, such as if a server reports an extent that does not take into account that the representation of features sometimes require a larger spatial extent than the features themselves. For example, if a point feature on the edge of the extent is drawn as a circle with a radius of 5 pixels, half of that circle will be cut off. config The configuration information to pass to the Carto Maps API.

For example, if this value is 1000, then tiles representing a scale larger than 1:1000 (i.e. numerically smaller denominator, when zooming in closer) will not be requested. Instead, tiles of the largest-available scale, as specified by this property, will be used and will simply get blurier as the user zooms in closer. maximumScaleBeforeMessage The denominator of the largest scale (smallest denominator) beyond which to show a message explaining that no further zoom levels are available, at the request of the data custodian. maximumShownFeatureInfos The maximum number of features whose information can be shown at one time in the Feature Info Panel, from this item. Defaults to terria.configParameters.defaultMaximumShownFeatureInfos metadataUrl The URL from which this data item's metadata description can be retrieved, or undefined if metadata is not available for this data item. The format of the metadata depends on the type of data item. For example, Web Map Service (WMS) data items provide their metadata via their GetCapabilities document. name The name of the item. nameInCatalog The name of this catalog member in the catalog. By default this is just name , but can be overridden. nowViewingIndex The index of the item in the Now Viewing list. Setting this property does not automatically change the order.

If false, 403s are assumed to just be missing tiles and need not be reported to the user. treat404AsError A value indicating whether a 404 response code when requesting a tile should be treated as an error. If false, 404s are assumed to just be missing tiles and need not be reported to the user. url The URL of this data. useOwnClock A flag indicating whether imagery should be displayed using this item's own clock (currentTime, multiplier), or, if false, the terria clock (whose current time is shown in the timeline UI). Default false. zoomOnEnable A value indicating whether the map will automatically zoom to this catalog item when it is enabled. Note that within a single init source: Catalog items with both isEnabled and zoomOnEnable set to true will override the top-level initialCamera property. If multiple catalog items have both isEnabled and zoomOnEnable set to true, it is undefined which one will affect the camera. In the case of multiple init sources, however, the camera will reflect whatever happens in the last init source, whether it is a result of a zoomOnEnable or an initialCamera ,","title":"ArcGIS MapServer (item)"},{"location":"connecting-to-data/catalog-type-details/esri-mapServer/#initialization-file-properties","text":"\"type\": \"esri-mapServer\" _nameInCatalog The name of the item to show in the catalog, if different from name . Default undefined. This property is observed. _sourceInfoItemNames The names of items in the CatalogMember's info array that contain details of the source of this CatalogMember's data.

If true, no part of the dataset will be displayed outside the rectangle. This property is true by default, leading to better performance and avoiding tile request errors that might occur when requesting tiles outside the server-specified rectangle. However, it may also cause features to be cut off in some cases, such as if a server reports an extent that does not take into account that the representation of features sometimes require a larger spatial extent than the features themselves. For example, if a point feature on the edge of the extent is drawn as a circle with a radius of 5 pixels, half of that circle will be cut off. customProperties The dictionary of custom item properties. dataCustodian A description of the custodian of this data item. This property is an HTML string that must be sanitized before display to the user. dataUrl The URL from which this data item's raw data can be retrieved, or undefined if raw data for this data item is not available. dataUrlType The type of the CatalogItem's dataUrl, or undefined if raw data for this data source is not available.

For example, historical and near-real-time satellite imagery often comes as daily swaths, with a given area on the globe potentially only covered every number of days. forceProxy Gets or sets whether or not this member should be forced to use a proxy. This property is not observable. hideSource Indicates that the source of this data should be hidden from the UI (obviously this isn't super-secure as you can just look at the network requests). id An optional unique id for this member, that is stable across renames and moves. Use uniqueId to get the canonical unique id for this CatalogMember, which is present even if there is no id. ignoreUnknownTileErrors A value indicating whether non-specific (no HTTP status code) tile errors should be ignored. This is a last resort, for dealing with odd cases such as data sources that return non-images (eg XML) with a 200 status code. No error messages will be shown to the user. initialMessage A message object that is presented to the user when an item or group is initially clicked The object is of the form {title:string, content:string, key: string, confirmation: boolean, confirmText: string, width: number, height: number}. initialTimeSource Options for the value of the animation timeline at start.

This only makes a difference if there is a time column and idColumns. In this case, if isSampled is true, then feature position, color and size are interpolated to produce smooth animation of the features over time. If isSampled is false, then times are treated as the start of periods, so that feature positions, color and size are kept constant from one time until the next, then change suddenly. Color and size are never interpolated when they are drawn from a text column. isShown A value indicating whether this data item is currently shown on the map. In order to be shown, the item must also be enabled. isUserSupplied A value indicating whether this member was supplied by the user rather than loaded from one of the Terria's initSources.

This property is used intenally to save/restore the Now Viewing order and is not intended for general use. nowViewingMessage A message to show when this item is enabled for the first time in order to call attention to the Now Viewing panel. opacity The opacity (alpha) of the data item, where 0.0 is fully transparent and 1.0 is fully opaque. providerId The provider id in the SDMX URL, eg. the final 'all' in http://stats.oecd.org/sdmx-json/data/QNA/.../all. Defaults to 'all'. rectangle The geographic rectangle (extent or bounding box) containing this data item. regionDimensionId The SDMX region dimension id, which is not displayed as a user-choosable dimension. Defaults to 'REGION'. regionNameTemplate A Mustache template used to turn the name of the region provided in the \"regionType\" variable into a csv-geo-au-compliant column name. The Mustache variable \"{{name}}\" holds the original name. You can use this to specify a year in the name, even if it is absent on the server. Eg. \"{{name}} code_2016\" converts STE to STE_code_2016. By default this is undefined. If it is undefined, the following rules are applied: - If there's a , replace the last one with code ; else append code. So SA4 -> SA4_code; SA4_2011 -> SA4_code_2011. - If the name ends in 4 digits without an underscore, insert \"_code \", eg. LGA2011 -> LGA_code_2011. regionType The regiontype directly, which is an alternative to including a regiontype in the data. Eg. \"cnt3\" would tell us that we should use cnt3 as the table column name. By default this is undefined. regionTypeDimensionId The SDMX region-type dimension id used with the region code to set the region type. Usually defaults to 'REGIONTYPE'. sdmxVersionNumber The SDMX version number Defaults to 2.0. selectedInitially The concepts which are initially selected, eg. {\"MEASURE\": [\"GDP\", \"GNP\"], \"FREQUENCY\": [\"A\"]}. Defaults to the first value in each dimension (when undefined). shortReport A short report to show on the now viewing tab. showWarnings Should any warnings like failures in region mapping be displayed to the user? showsInfo A value indicating whether this data source should show an info icon. sortValues Gets or sets how to re-sort the values that appear in the SDMX-JSON response, in the Now Viewing panel. The default is null, so that the order is maintained (except for totalValueIds, which are moved to the top). By setting this to 'name' or 'id', the values are sorted into alphabetical and/or numerical order either by name or by id, respectively. startTime The startTime to use as part of the ?startTime=...&endTime=... query parameters. Currently a string, but could be extended to be an object with frequency codes as keys. By default this is undefined, and not used as part of the query. timePeriodDimensionId The SDMX time period dimension id, which is not displayed as a user-choosable dimension. Defaults to 'TIME_PERIOD'. totalValueIds Gets or sets value ids for each dimension which correspond to total values. Place the grand total first. If all dimensions (except region-type, region and frequency) have totals available, then a \"Display as a percentage of regional total\" option becomes available. Eg. Suppose AGE had \"10\" for 10 year olds, etc, plus \"ALL\" for all ages, \"U21\" and \"21PLUS\" for under and over 21 year olds. Then you would want to specify {\"AGE\": [\"ALL\", \"U21\", \"21PLUS\"]}. In this case, when the user selects one of these values, any other values will be unselected. And when the user selects any other value (eg. \"10\"), if any of these values were selected, they will be unselected. In addition, any values provided under a wildcard \" \" key are used for all dimensions, and are shown first in the list, if present, eg. {\" \": [\"ALL\"], \"AGE\": [\"U21\", \"21PLUS\"]}. url The URL of this data. useOwnClock A flag indicating whether imagery should be displayed using this item's own clock (currentTime, multiplier), or, if false, the terria clock (whose current time is shown in the timeline UI). Default false. whitelist Gets or sets each dimension's allowed values, by id. Eg. {\"SUBJECT\": [\"GDP\", \"GNP\"], \"FREQUENCY\": [\"A\"]}. If not defined, all values are allowed. If a dimension is not present, all values for that dimension are allowed. Note this will not be applied to regions or time periods. The expression is first matched as a regular expression (sandwiched between ^ and &); if that fails, it is matched as a literal string. So eg. \"[0-9]+\" will match 015 but not A015. zoomOnEnable A value indicating whether the map will automatically zoom to this catalog item when it is enabled. Note that within a single init source: Catalog items with both isEnabled and zoomOnEnable set to true will override the top-level initialCamera property. If multiple catalog items have both isEnabled and zoomOnEnable set to true, it is undefined which one will affect the camera. In the case of multiple init sources, however, the camera will reflect whatever happens in the last init source, whether it is a result of a zoomOnEnable or an initialCamera ,","title":"SDMX-JSON (item)"},{"location":"connecting-to-data/catalog-type-details/sdmx-json/#initialization-file-properties","text":"\"type\": \"sdmx-json\" _nameInCatalog The name of the item to show in the catalog, if different from name . Default undefined. This property is observed. _sourceInfoItemNames The names of items in the CatalogMember's info array that contain details of the source of this CatalogMember's data. This should be overridden by children of this class. aggregatedDimensionIds An array of dimension ids whose values should not be shown in the Now Viewing panel; instead, their values should be aggregated and treated as a single value. Eg. useful if a dimension is repeated (eg. STATE and REGION). NOTE: Currently only a single aggregatedDimensionId is supported. This should not be applied to regions or time periods. blacklist Gets or sets each dimension's non-allowed values, by id. Eg. {\"COB\": [\"TOTAL\", \"1\"], \"FREQUENCY\": [\"Q\"]}. If not defined, all values are allowed (subject to the whitelist). If a dimension is not present, all values for that dimension are allowed (subject to the whitelist). Note this will not be applied to regions or time periods. If the same value is in both the whitelist and the blacklist, the blacklist wins. The expression is first matched as a regular expression (sandwiched between ^ and &); if that fails, it is matched as a literal string. So eg. \"[0-9]+\" will match 015 but not A015. cacheDuration The cache duration to use for proxied URLs for this catalog member. If undefined, proxied URLs are effectively cachable forever. The duration is expressed as a Varnish-like duration string, such as '1d' (one day) or '10000s' (ten thousand seconds). canDisplayPercent Gets or sets whether this item can show percentages instead of raw values. This is set to true automatically if total value ids are available on all necessary columns. cannotDisplayPercentMap Deprecated. Use cannotSum instead. Defaults to none. cannotSum A mapping of concept ids to arrays of values which, if selected, mean the results cannot be summed. If one of these values is chosen: - Does not show the \"canDisplayPercent\" option. - Explains to the user that it can't show multiple values of concepts. eg. {\"MEASURE\": [\"rate\"]}. Can also be the boolean \"true\", if it should apply to all selections. Defaults to none. cleanFootnotes Gets or sets whether to remove trailing \"(x)\"s from the values that appear in the SDMX-JSON response. If true, for example, \"Total responses(c)\" would be replaced with \"Total responses\". This is a workaround for an ABS-specific issue. Default false. customProperties The dictionary of custom item properties. data The data, represented as a binary Blob, a string, or a Promise for one of those things. If this property is set, CatalogItem's url is ignored. dataCustodian A description of the custodian of this data item. This property is an HTML string that must be sanitized before display to the user. dataSourceUrl The URL from which the TableCatalogItem's data was obtained. This is informational; it is not used. This propery is observable. dataUrl The URL from which this data item's raw data can be retrieved, or undefined if raw data for this data item is not available. dataUrlComponent The 'data' SDMX URL component, eg. 'data' in http://stats.oecd.org/sdmx-json/data/QNA. Defaults to 'data'. dataUrlType The type of the CatalogItem's dataUrl, or undefined if raw data for this data source is not available. Valid values are: * direct - A direct link to the data. * wfs - A Web Feature Service (WFS) base URL. If CatalogItem's dataUrl is not specified, the base URL will be this data item's URL. * wfs-complete - A complete, ready-to-use link to download features from a WFS server. * none - There is no data link. dataflowUrlComponent The 'dataflow' SDMX URL component, eg. 'dataflow' in http://stats.oecd.org/sdmx-json/dataflow/QNA. Defaults to 'dataflow'. dateFormat Options for formatting current time and timeline tic labels. Options are: currentTime // Current time in time slider will be shown in this format. For example \"mmmm yyyy\" for Jan 2016. timelineTic // Timeline tics will have this label. For example \"yyyy\" will cause each tic to be labelled with the year. description The description of the item. displayChoicesBeforeLegend A flag which determines whether the legend comes before (false) or after (true) the display variable choice. Default true. displayPercent Gets or sets whether to show percentages or raw values. endTime The endTime to use as part of the ?startTime=...&endTime=... query parameters. Currently a string, but could be extended to be an object with frequency codes as keys. By default this is undefined, and not used as part of the query. featureInfoTemplate A template to display message in a info box. May be a string or an object with template, name and/or partials properties. forceProxy Gets or sets whether or not this member should be forced to use a proxy. This property is not observable. forceShowDimensionIds An array of dimension ids which, if present, should be shown to the user, even if there is only one value. This is useful if the name of the dataset doesn't convey what is in it, but one of the dimension values does. Eg. ['MEASURE']. Default []. frequencyDimensionId The SDMX frequency dimension id. Defaults to 'FREQUENCY'. hideSource Indicates that the source of this data should be hidden from the UI (obviously this isn't super-secure as you can just look at the network requests). id An optional unique id for this member, that is stable across renames and moves. Use uniqueId to get the canonical unique id for this CatalogMember, which is present even if there is no id. initialMessage A message object that is presented to the user when an item or group is initially clicked The object is of the form {title:string, content:string, key: string, confirmation: boolean, confirmText: string, width: number, height: number}. isEnabled A value indicating whether this data item is enabled. An enabled data item appears in the \"Now Viewing\" pane, but is not necessarily shown on the map. isHidden A value indicating whether this item is hidden from the catalog. This property is observable. isLegendVisible A value indicating whether the legend for this data item is currently visible. isLoading A value indicating whether this data source is currently loading. isMappable A value indicating whether this data source can be shown on the map (as opposed to a time-series dataset, for instance, which can only be shown in a chart). isPromoted A value indicating whether this item is kept above other non-promoted items. isSampled A value indicating whether the rows correspond to \"sampled\" data. This only makes a difference if there is a time column and idColumns. In this case, if isSampled is true, then feature position, color and size are interpolated to produce smooth animation of the features over time. If isSampled is false, then times are treated as the start of periods, so that feature positions, color and size are kept constant from one time until the next, then change suddenly. Color and size are never interpolated when they are drawn from a text column. isShown A value indicating whether this data item is currently shown on the map. In order to be shown, the item must also be enabled. isUserSupplied A value indicating whether this member was supplied by the user rather than loaded from one of the Terria's initSources. User-supplied members must be serialized completely when, for example, serializing enabled members for sharing. isWaitingForDisclaimer Whether this catalog member is waiting for a disclaimer to be accepted before showing itself. keepOnTop Keeps the layer on top of all other imagery layers. legendUrl The URL of the legend to show when this catalog item is enabled. If there is more than one legend URL, this property returns the first one. legendUrls The URLs of the legends to show when this catalog item is enabled. maximumShownFeatureInfos The maximum number of features whose information can be shown at one time in the Feature Info Panel, from this item. Defaults to terria.configParameters.defaultMaximumShownFeatureInfos measureDimensionId The measure dimension id Defaults to 'MEASURE'. metadataUrl The URL from which this data item's metadata description can be retrieved, or undefined if metadata is not available for this data item. The format of the metadata depends on the type of data item. For example, Web Map Service (WMS) data items provide their metadata via their GetCapabilities document. name The name of the item. nameInCatalog The name of this catalog member in the catalog. By default this is just name , but can be overridden. nowViewingIndex The index of the item in the Now Viewing list. Setting this property does not automatically change the order. This property is used intenally to save/restore the Now Viewing order and is not intended for general use. nowViewingMessage A message to show when this item is enabled for the first time in order to call attention to the Now Viewing panel. opacity The opacity (alpha) of the data item, where 0.0 is fully transparent and 1.0 is fully opaque. providerId The provider id in the SDMX URL, eg. the final 'all' in http://stats.oecd.org/sdmx-json/data/QNA/.../all. Defaults to 'all'. rectangle The geographic rectangle (extent or bounding box) containing this data item. regionDimensionId The SDMX region dimension id, which is not displayed as a user-choosable dimension. Defaults to 'REGION'. regionNameTemplate A Mustache template used to turn the name of the region provided in the \"regionType\" variable into a csv-geo-au-compliant column name. The Mustache variable \"{{name}}\" holds the original name. You can use this to specify a year in the name, even if it is absent on the server. Eg. \"{{name}} code_2016\" converts STE to STE_code_2016. By default this is undefined. If it is undefined, the following rules are applied: - If there's a , replace the last one with code ; else append code. So SA4 -> SA4_code; SA4_2011 -> SA4_code_2011. - If the name ends in 4 digits without an underscore, insert \"_code \", eg. LGA2011 -> LGA_code_2011. regionType The regiontype directly, which is an alternative to including a regiontype in the data. Eg. \"cnt3\" would tell us that we should use cnt3 as the table column name. By default this is undefined. regionTypeDimensionId The SDMX region-type dimension id used with the region code to set the region type. Usually defaults to 'REGIONTYPE'. sdmxVersionNumber The SDMX version number Defaults to 2.0. selectedInitially The concepts which are initially selected, eg. {\"MEASURE\": [\"GDP\", \"GNP\"], \"FREQUENCY\": [\"A\"]}. Defaults to the first value in each dimension (when undefined). shortReport A short report to show on the now viewing tab. showWarnings Should any warnings like failures in region mapping be displayed to the user? showsInfo A value indicating whether this data source should show an info icon. sortValues Gets or sets how to re-sort the values that appear in the SDMX-JSON response, in the Now Viewing panel. The default is null, so that the order is maintained (except for totalValueIds, which are moved to the top). By setting this to 'name' or 'id', the values are sorted into alphabetical and/or numerical order either by name or by id, respectively. startTime The startTime to use as part of the ?startTime=...&endTime=... query parameters. Currently a string, but could be extended to be an object with frequency codes as keys. By default this is undefined, and not used as part of the query. timePeriodDimensionId The SDMX time period dimension id, which is not displayed as a user-choosable dimension. Defaults to 'TIME_PERIOD'. totalValueIds Gets or sets value ids for each dimension which correspond to total values. Place the grand total first. If all dimensions (except region-type, region and frequency) have totals available, then a \"Display as a percentage of regional total\" option becomes available. Eg. Suppose AGE had \"10\" for 10 year olds, etc, plus \"ALL\" for all ages, \"U21\" and \"21PLUS\" for under and over 21 year olds. Then you would want to specify {\"AGE\": [\"ALL\", \"U21\", \"21PLUS\"]}. In this case, when the user selects one of these values, any other values will be unselected. And when the user selects any other value (eg. \"10\"), if any of these values were selected, they will be unselected. In addition, any values provided under a wildcard \" \" key are used for all dimensions, and are shown first in the list, if present, eg. {\" \": [\"ALL\"], \"AGE\": [\"U21\", \"21PLUS\"]}. url The URL of this data. useOwnClock A flag indicating whether imagery should be displayed using this item's own clock (currentTime, multiplier), or, if false, the terria clock (whose current time is shown in the timeline UI). Default false. whitelist Gets or sets each dimension's allowed values, by id. Eg. {\"SUBJECT\": [\"GDP\", \"GNP\"], \"FREQUENCY\": [\"A\"]}. If not defined, all values are allowed. If a dimension is not present, all values for that dimension are allowed. Note this will not be applied to regions or time periods. The expression is first matched as a regular expression (sandwiched between ^ and &); if that fails, it is matched as a literal string. So eg. \"[0-9]+\" will match 015 but not A015. zoomOnEnable A value indicating whether the map will automatically zoom to this catalog item when it is enabled. Note that within a single init source: Catalog items with both isEnabled and zoomOnEnable set to true will override the top-level initialCamera property. If multiple catalog items have both isEnabled and zoomOnEnable set to true, it is undefined which one will affect the camera.

If there is more than one legend URL, this property returns the first one. legendUrls The URLs of the legends to show when this catalog item is enabled. maximumShownFeatureInfos The maximum number of features whose information can be shown at one time in the Feature Info Panel, from this item. Defaults to terria.configParameters.defaultMaximumShownFeatureInfos metadataUrl The URL from which this data item's metadata description can be retrieved, or undefined if metadata is not available for this data item. The format of the metadata depends on the type of data item. For example, Web Map Service (WMS) data items provide their metadata via their GetCapabilities document. name The name of the item. nameInCatalog The name of this catalog member in the catalog. By default this is just name , but can be overridden. nowViewingIndex The index of the item in the Now Viewing list. Setting this property does not automatically change the order. This property is used intenally to save/restore the Now Viewing order and is not intended for general use. nowViewingMessage A message to show when this item is enabled for the first time in order to call attention to the Now Viewing panel. observablePropertiesName The name seen by the user for the list of observable properties. Defaults to \"Property\", but eg. for BoM, \"Observation type\" would be better. opacity The opacity (alpha) of the data item, where 0.0 is fully transparent and 1.0 is fully opaque. proceduresName The name seen by the user for the list of procedures. Defaults to \"Procedure\", but eg. for BoM, \"Frequency\" would be better. rectangle The geographic rectangle (extent or bounding box) containing this data item. requestTemplate The template XML string to POST to the SOS server to query for GetObservation. If this property is undefined, SensorObservationServiceCatalogItem.defaultRequestTemplate is used. This is used as a Mustache template. See SensorObservationServiceRequestTemplate.xml for the default. Be careful with newlines inside tags: Mustache can add an extra space in the front of them, which causes the request to fail on the SOS server. Eg. http://www.opengis.net/... will render as http://www.opengis.net/... The space before the \"http\" will cause the request to fail. shortReport A short report to show on the now viewing tab. showWarnings Should any warnings like failures in region mapping be displayed to the user? showsInfo A value indicating whether this data source should show an info icon. startDate A start date in ISO8601 format. All requests filter to this start date. Set to undefined for no temporal filter. tryToLoadObservationData A flag. If true, the catalog item will load all features, then, if number of features < requestSizeLimit * requestNumberLimit, it will load all the observation data for those features, and show that. If false, or there are too many features, the observation data is only loaded when the feature is clicked on (via a chart in the feature info panel). Defaults to true. url The URL of this data. useOwnClock A flag indicating whether imagery should be displayed using this item's own clock (currentTime, multiplier), or, if false, the terria clock (whose current time is shown in the timeline UI). Default false. zoomOnEnable A value indicating whether the map will automatically zoom to this catalog item when it is enabled. Note that within a single init source: Catalog items with both isEnabled and zoomOnEnable set to true will override the top-level initialCamera property. If multiple catalog items have both isEnabled and zoomOnEnable set to true, it is undefined which one will affect the camera.

A CatalogFunction that issues an HTTP GET to a service with a set of query parameters specified by the TerriaJsonCatalogFunction's inputs property, and expects to receive back TerriaJS catalog/share JSON. When this CatalogFunction is added to the catalog, TerriaJS automatically creates a user interface for it based on the inputs. When the user clicks \"Run Analysis\", it issues an HTTP GET with the user-specified inputs supplied as part of the query string.

For example, if this value is 1000, then tiles representing a scale larger than 1:1000 (i.e. numerically smaller denominator, when zooming in closer) will not be requested. Instead, tiles of the largest-available scale, as specified by this property, will be used and will simply get blurier as the user zooms in closer. name The name of the item. nameInCatalog The name of this catalog member in the catalog.

The result is: instead of: You can provide a template to use for the name of the collapsible section (eg. to replace RGB in the example above), like so: \"featureInfoTemplate\" : { \"template\": \"<div>Pixel colour: {{>foobar}}</div>\", \"name\": \"Red {{Red}}\" } More details The template is rendered using Mustache , so you can use all of its features here. In particular, you can render properties that include html by using triple-braces, eg. {{{property}}} . You can make use of partial templates (and even recursive templates) by specifying your template and partials as a json object, eg.: \"featureInfoTemplate\" : { \"template\": \"<div>Pixel colour: {{>foobar}}</div>\", \"partials\": { \"foobar\": \"<b>Red={{Red}} Blue={{Blue}} Green={{Green}}</b>\" } } After Mustache has rendered the template, the result is displayed using Markdown , so you could also write: \"featureInfoTemplate\" : \"Pixel colour: *Red={{Red}} Blue={{Blue}} Green={{Green}}*.\" Formatting numbers The preferred way to format numbers is using the formats option, eg: \"featureInfoTemplate\": { \"template\": \"Pixel colour: <b>Red={{Red}} Blue={{Blue}} Green={{Green}}</b>.\", \"formats\": { \"Red\": { \"type\": \"number\", \"maximumFractionDigits\": 2 }, \"Green\": { \"type\": \"number\", \"maximumFractionDigits\": 2 }, \"Blue\": { \"type\": \"number\", \"maximumFractionDigits\": 2 } } } \"type\" specifies the type of formatting that will be applied to the property. Here we are using \"number\" formatting which is also the default formatting if \"type\" is not supplied. The supported format options are: \"maximumFractionDigits\": X : To reduce the number of decimal places to a maximum of X digits. \"minimumFractionDigits\": X : To increase the number of decimal places to a minimum of X digits. \"useGrouping\": true : To show thousands separators. \"style\": \"percent\" : To show 0.15 as 15%. A second method is to use terria.formatNumber directly in the template. This accepts an initial JSON string describing the same options as above. To simplify the notation, the quotes around the keys are optional here. \"featureInfoTemplate\": \"template\": \"Pixel colour: <b>Red={{#terria.formatNumber}}{maximumFractionDigits:3}{{Red}}{{/terria.formatNumber}}</b>.\" URL-encoding strings To URL-encode a value in a template, use terria.urlEncode or terria.urlEncodeComponent . For example: Test: {{#terria.urlEncode}}http://example.com/a b{{/terria.urlEncode}} Test: {{#terria.urlEncodeComponent}}W/HOE#1{{/terria.urlEncodeComponent}} Formatting dates Similar to formatting numbers you can format dates in the \"formats\" section by suppliying \"dateTime\" in the \"type\" property, eg: \"featureInfoTemplate\": { \"template\": \"Date: {{Date}}\", \"formats\": { \"Date\": { \"type\": \"dateTime\"; \"format\": \"dd-mm-yyyy HH:MM:ss\"; } } } The date format style used for the \"format\" property is the style from the npm dateformat package , e.g. \"dd-mm-yyyy HH:MM:ss\" or \"isoDateTime\" . As with number you can also use terria.dateTimeformat directly in the template. This accepts an initial JSON string describing the same options as above. \"featureInfoTemplate\": \"template\": \"{{#terria.formatDateTime}}{format: \\\"dd-mm-yyyy HH:MM:ss\\\"}2017-11-23T08:47:53Z{{/terria.formatDateTime}}</b>.\" Time-series charts For features with time-varying table-based data structures (eg. CSV, SOS2, SDMX-JSON, if there is a time column), the feature info panel also includes a chart of the data over time, eg. You can place this chart in your template using {{terria.timeSeries.chart}} . Alternatively, you can access the following component information: {{terria.timeSeries.xName}} - the x-column name {{terria.timeSeries.yName}} - the y-column name {{terria.timeSeries.title}} {{terria.timeSeries.id}} {{terria.timeSeries.units}} - the column units as a comma-separated string. {{terria.timeSeries.data}} - the data as a comma-separated string. Please note: * If any of the component information above contains double-quotes, double quotes will be removed before TerriaJS processes the template further. * If any of the component information above is used as part of tag attributes, it must be surrounded by double-quotes. e.g. <chart y-column=\"{{terria.timeSeries.yName}}\"></chart> So you could reconstruct the chart manually as: <h4>{{terria.timeSeries.title}}</h4> <chart x-column=\"{{terria.timeSeries.xName}}\" y-column=\"{{terria.timeSeries.yName}}\" id=\"{{terria.timeSeries.id}}\" column-units=\"{{terria.timeSeries.units}}\"> {{terria.timeSeries.data}} </chart> or use this as a basis to customise the chart.

This property is ignored if colorMap is defined. colorBinMethod Use this to force a particular method for quantizing colors. The alternatives are \"auto\" (the default), \"ckmeans\", \"quantile\" or \"none\" (equivalent to \"colorBins\": 0 ). imageUrl For lat/lon datasets, if you want to use a particular image instead of a circle, you can specify its url as the imageUrl , eg. in test.json : \"imageUrl\": \"test/images/pow32.png\", Sizing scale The size of each point (or image), eg. \"tableStyle\": { \"scale\": 2 } scaleByValue A Boolean for whether points should be scaled by the value of the selected dataVariable . Defaults to false . \"tableStyle\": { \"scale\": 2, \"scaleByValue\": true } minDisplayValue All data values less than or equal to this are considered equal for the purpose of display. maxDisplayValue All data values greater than or equal to this are considered equal for the purpose of display. clampDisplayValue A Boolean - if true, display values that fall outside the display range show as min and max colors.

Using a Custom Version of Cesium","title":"Overview"},{"location":"contributing/architecture/","text":"TerriaJS is usually used in a single-page web application to provide mapping and catalog exploration capabilities. It is written in ECMAScript (JavaScript) 2015+ and compiled to ECMAScript 5 in order to run in any relatively modern web browser, including Internet Explorer 9 or later. Some features, such as 3D and vector tile region mapping, require more recent browsers, but TerriaJS can be expected to degrade gracefully in older browsers by disabling unsupported features or informing the user of the limitations of their browser. Layers TerriaJS has a number of subdirectories of the lib directory, each of which corresponds to a conceptual layer in the design of TerriaJS. The layers are: Name Purpose ThirdParty This directory contains third-party code that is not available via npm packages for whatever reason. Core Low-level utility classes and functions that don't depend on a UI toolkit (i.e. React) or a mapping library (i.e. Cesium or Leaflet). Map Classes and functions to work with or extend a mapping library (i.e. Cesium or Leaflet). This layer should not depend on a particular UI toolkit (i.e. React). Charts Similar to the Map layer, except for charting instead of mapping. This depends on the charting library (D3) but not on React. Models This is heart of TerriaJS. Classes and functions in this layer know how to interface with catalog servers, map servers, and geospatial data formats. Most of the logic of a TerriaJS application is found in this layer. However, it does not depend on React. ViewModels and ReactViewModels Contains classes and functions that are closely associated with the UI but cannot be described as React components or views. These two directories are separate mostly for historical reasons; there is little practical difference between them. ReactViews This is the React-based user interface of TerriaJS. All of the React components are found in this layer. User interface TerriaJS uses the React library as the basis for its user interface. The top-level entry point is StandardUserInterface.jsx . It is expected that most applications will use this standard user interface, but a sophisticated TerriaJS application could use its own version instead in order to allow extreme customization of the interface. For styling, we use Sass in CSS modules loaded via the Webpack css-loader , meaning that each React component imports its own local CSS styles from a .scss file. The user interface is meant to be a thin layer with minimal domain-specific logic. Ideally, all domain-specific logic would reside in the Models layer or perhaps in the ViewModels layer. This approach allows the UI to be replaced (including by a user of TerriaJS rather than its developers) without needing to re-implement large chunks of TerriaJS logic. In fact, the entire user interface can be viewed as optional. A TerriaJS-based application could replace it with its own custom UI. Observables and ObserveModelMixin Virtually all TerriaJS state is stored in instances of classes in the Models and ViewModels layers. Many changes to this state are initiated by actions in the user interface. For example, the user clicks an Add to Map button and a number of state changes take place that eventually cause the catalog item to appear on the map. Some changes, however, come from elsewhere. For example, when the user drags a JSON catalog file onto the map, this may cause any number of changes to objects in the Models layer. In addition, the Models layer itself is usable as an API for TerriaJS. Developers can add custom user interface components or other functionality that manipulate the objects in the Models layer. It's important that the user interface update to reflect the new state, whether the state change was initiated by the core TerriaJS UI or not. To that end, most of the properties of objects in the Models and ViewModels layers are observable. Near the bottom of the constructor of most model objects ( UrlTemplateCatalogItem for example), you'll see a line like this: knockout.track(this, ['minimumLevel', 'maximumLevel', 'attribution', 'subdomains', 'tileDiscardPolicy']); knockout.track transforms each of the named properties on the given object ( this in this case) into an observable property. A Knockout observable property is just like a normal property; you can get and set its value as normal. On top of that, however, an observable property raises an event when it changes. For example, if we have a UrlTemplateCatalogItem instance in a variable named urlTemplateCatalogItem , we can subscribe to its minimumLevel property like this: knockout.getObservable(urlTemplateCatalogItem, 'minimumLevel').subscribe(function() { alert('minimumLevel changed!'); }); Many model classes also define computed properties, which are defined using either overrideProperty or knockout.defineProperty . Computed properties have a getter and optionally a setter. The getter is invoked once the first time the property is accessed and the value is memoized (cached). Further accesses of the property will get the memoized value. However, Knockout automatically keeps track of the set of observables (including other computed observables) that were accessed during the execution of the getter. If any of those properties change, the computed observable's getter will be invoked again and the new value memoized. This new invocation may access different observables properties than it did the first time around, and it is those new properties that will trigger any future re-evaluations of the computed property. We can subscribe to change notification on computed properties in the same way we subscribe to regular observable properties. It's rarely necessary to explicitly subscribe to an observable, though. In the React components in the TerriaJS user interface, we use a React mix-in called ObserveModelMixin . When this mix-in is included in a component, the React render method acts a bit like a computed observable. It automatically keeps track of all the observables that were read in the course of rendering the component. If any of them change, the component will be automatically re-rendered. With ObserveModelMixin , in most cases it's not necessary to think very much about the TerriaJS state when developing the UI. Just write your render method as a pure function that produces virtual DOM nodes from the current state of the application, and rest assured that your render method will be called again if that state ever changes in a way that might affect what is shown to the user. For more details of Knockout observables, see Knockout-ES5 as well as the main Knockout documentation . It may seem a bit stange that we're using Knockout, which is itself a user interface framework, in a library that uses React for its user interface. In fact, we're not using the UI or DOM manipulation parts of Knockout at all. We're only using it as an observable library. Knockout's observables are feature rich and well tested, and make a great complement to React when paired with our ObserveModelMixin . Major Components in Models To help understand the code in Models, here is a summary of some of the major components of TerriaJS: Terria The root of the TerriaJS application state. A TerriaJS-based application typically has only one Terria instance, though it is possible to have more in unusual situations. All other objects can generally be found via this instance. Catalog The TerriaJS catalog, built up from JSON init files as described in the Customizing section. The Catalog is what you're looking at when you press the Add data button the UI. It is accessible from the catalog property on the Terria instance. NowViewing Also known as the Workbench, this is shown in the panel on the left side of the UI, under the Add Data button. This is the set of all enabled catalog items. When the isEnabled property is set to true on a CatalogItem , it will appear here. It is accessible from the nowViewing property on the Terria instance. CatalogMember This is the base class for everything in the catalog, including CatalogGroup , CatalogItem , and CatalogFunction . CatalogGroup A group of items in the catalog, shown as a folder in the UI. The CatalogGroup class itself has a fixed set of items it holds, but derived classes can and do dynamically load their list of items from a remote server. For a list of available catalog groups, see Catalog Groups . CatalogItem A catalog item can be enabled by settings its isEnabled property to true , at which point it appears in the Now Viewing / Workbench. Usually an enabled catalog item also has a representation on the map and / or on the chart panel, though this is not strictly required. For a list of available catalog items, see Catalog Items . CatalogFunction Unlike a CatalogItem , a CatalogFunction cannot be directly enabled. Instead, the user supplies parameters to the function and invokes it, and the result is a CatalogItem that is shown on the Workbench. A Web Processing Service (WPS) is an excellent example of a CatalogFunction . For a list of available catalog functions, see Catalog Functions . GlobeOrMap The base class for a map view. TerriaJS currently includes derived classes for a 3D view based on Cesium ( Cesium class) and a 2D view based on Leaflet ( Leaflet class). Mapping All mapping in TerriaJS happens through the abstractions provided by Cesium . Whether you're using the 3D Cesium view or the 2D Leaflet view, raster map layers are represented using Cesium's ImageryProvider type and vector layers are represented using Cesium's DataSource and Entity types. Cesium's tutorials are a great introduction to these topics, especially the Imagery Layers and Visualizing Spatial Data tutorials. The code that renders these Cesium types on a Leaflet map is found in the Map layer, particularly CesiumTileLayer and LeafletVisualizer . In some specialized cases, such as CesiumTerrainCatalogItem , catalog items directly interact with an underlying mapping engine rather than using the ImageryProvider and DataSource abstractions. Build Architecture TerriaJS and TerriaJS-based applications are built using Webpack . A number of Webpack loaders are used to handle the various types of assets and transformations that TerriaJS requires. An application that uses TerriaJS is expected to set up Webpack for its own needs and then call configureWebpack to configure Webpack for TerriaJS. configureWebpack takes care to avoid impacting Webpack configuration outside of TerriaJS itself. It may be possible to build a TerriaJS application using a tool other than Webpack, such as Browserify or Rollup, but it is unlikely to be easy. If you decide to attempt this, consider dropping by Gitter or the TerriaJS forum .","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"contributing/architecture/#layers","text":"TerriaJS has a number of subdirectories of the lib directory, each of which corresponds to a conceptual layer in the design of TerriaJS.

Charts Similar to the Map layer, except for charting instead of mapping. This depends on the charting library (D3) but not on React. Models This is heart of TerriaJS. Classes and functions in this layer know how to interface with catalog servers, map servers, and geospatial data formats. Most of the logic of a TerriaJS application is found in this layer. However, it does not depend on React. ViewModels and ReactViewModels Contains classes and functions that are closely associated with the UI but cannot be described as React components or views. These two directories are separate mostly for historical reasons; there is little practical difference between them. ReactViews This is the React-based user interface of TerriaJS. All of the React components are found in this layer.","title":"Layers"},{"location":"contributing/architecture/#user-interface","text":"TerriaJS uses the React library as the basis for its user interface. The top-level entry point is StandardUserInterface.jsx . It is expected that most applications will use this standard user interface, but a sophisticated TerriaJS application could use its own version instead in order to allow extreme customization of the interface. For styling, we use Sass in CSS modules loaded via the Webpack css-loader , meaning that each React component imports its own local CSS styles from a .scss file. The user interface is meant to be a thin layer with minimal domain-specific logic. Ideally, all domain-specific logic would reside in the Models layer or perhaps in the ViewModels layer. This approach allows the UI to be replaced (including by a user of TerriaJS rather than its developers) without needing to re-implement large chunks of TerriaJS logic. In fact, the entire user interface can be viewed as optional. A TerriaJS-based application could replace it with its own custom UI.","title":"User interface"},{"location":"contributing/architecture/#observables-and-observemodelmixin","text":"Virtually all TerriaJS state is stored in instances of classes in the Models and ViewModels layers. Many changes to this state are initiated by actions in the user interface. For example, the user clicks an Add to Map button and a number of state changes take place that eventually cause the catalog item to appear on the map. Some changes, however, come from elsewhere. For example, when the user drags a JSON catalog file onto the map, this may cause any number of changes to objects in the Models layer. In addition, the Models layer itself is usable as an API for TerriaJS. Developers can add custom user interface components or other functionality that manipulate the objects in the Models layer. It's important that the user interface update to reflect the new state, whether the state change was initiated by the core TerriaJS UI or not. To that end, most of the properties of objects in the Models and ViewModels layers are observable. Near the bottom of the constructor of most model objects ( UrlTemplateCatalogItem for example), you'll see a line like this: knockout.track(this, ['minimumLevel', 'maximumLevel', 'attribution', 'subdomains', 'tileDiscardPolicy']); knockout.track transforms each of the named properties on the given object ( this in this case) into an observable property. A Knockout observable property is just like a normal property; you can get and set its value as normal. On top of that, however, an observable property raises an event when it changes. For example, if we have a UrlTemplateCatalogItem instance in a variable named urlTemplateCatalogItem , we can subscribe to its minimumLevel property like this: knockout.getObservable(urlTemplateCatalogItem, 'minimumLevel').subscribe(function() { alert('minimumLevel changed!'); }); Many model classes also define computed properties, which are defined using either overrideProperty or knockout.defineProperty . Computed properties have a getter and optionally a setter. The getter is invoked once the first time the property is accessed and the value is memoized (cached). Further accesses of the property will get the memoized value. However, Knockout automatically keeps track of the set of observables (including other computed observables) that were accessed during the execution of the getter. If any of those properties change, the computed observable's getter will be invoked again and the new value memoized. This new invocation may access different observables properties than it did the first time around, and it is those new properties that will trigger any future re-evaluations of the computed property. We can subscribe to change notification on computed properties in the same way we subscribe to regular observable properties. It's rarely necessary to explicitly subscribe to an observable, though. In the React components in the TerriaJS user interface, we use a React mix-in called ObserveModelMixin . When this mix-in is included in a component, the React render method acts a bit like a computed observable. It automatically keeps track of all the observables that were read in the course of rendering the component. If any of them change, the component will be automatically re-rendered. With ObserveModelMixin , in most cases it's not necessary to think very much about the TerriaJS state when developing the UI. Just write your render method as a pure function that produces virtual DOM nodes from the current state of the application, and rest assured that your render method will be called again if that state ever changes in a way that might affect what is shown to the user. For more details of Knockout observables, see Knockout-ES5 as well as the main Knockout documentation . It may seem a bit stange that we're using Knockout, which is itself a user interface framework, in a library that uses React for its user interface. In fact, we're not using the UI or DOM manipulation parts of Knockout at all. We're only using it as an observable library. Knockout's observables are feature rich and well tested, and make a great complement to React when paired with our ObserveModelMixin .","title":"Observables and ObserveModelMixin"},{"location":"contributing/architecture/#major-components-in-models","text":"To help understand the code in Models, here is a summary of some of the major components of TerriaJS:","title":"Major Components in Models"},{"location":"contributing/architecture/#terria","text":"The root of the TerriaJS application state.

Building a TerriaMap against a modified TerriaJS What if you need to make changes to TerriaJS while working on a site that depends on it? In the process described in Getting Started , the TerriaJS package is installed to the node_modules directory by npm install . Please do not edit TerriaJS directly in the node_modules directory, because changes will be clobbered the next time you run npm install . Instead, we want to clone TerriaJS from its GitHub repo and use that in our TerriaMap build. Traditionally, npm link is the way to do this. However, we do not recommend use of npm link because it frequently leads to multiple copies of some libraries being installed, which in turn leads to all sorts of frustrating build problems. Instead, we recommend yarn and its workspaces feature. yarn workspaces let us safely clone a git repo into the packages directory and wire it into any other packages that use it. First, install yarn globally: npm install -g yarn If you already have yarn installed, make sure it is at least v1.0 (we recommend using the latest version). Older versions do not support the workspace feature. Then, enable workspaces by editing the TerriaMap package.json file, adding these lines to the top, just after the opening { : \"private\": true, \"workspaces\": { \"packages\": [\"packages/*\"], \"nohoist\": [\"**/husky\"] }, Do not commit this change. Now, you can clone any package (such as terriajs or terriajs-cesium ) into the packages directory: mkdir packages cd packages git clone https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs.git cd .. This will give you the master branch of TerriaJS. While we strive to keep master stable and usable at all times, you must be aware that master is less tested than actual releases, and it may not be commpatible with the master branch of TerriaMap. So, you may want to check out the actual version of TerriaJS that you're using before you start making changes. To do that: grep terriajs package.json # will print something like: \"terriajs\": \"^4.5.0\" cd packages/terriajs git checkout 4.5.0 cd .. Note The version of TerriaJS in your packages/terriajs directory must be semver-compatible with the version specification in TerriaMap's package.json . If it's not, yarn will install a separate semver-compatible version of TerriaJS in node_modules instead of using the one you've put in packages/terriajs . The version numbers are usually already aligned, but if not, change the \"terriajs\": \"x.y.z\" dependency in TerriaMap's package.json to be the exact \"version\" property in TerriaJS's package.json . You will generally not want to commit this change. Then, in the TerriaMap directory, run: yarn install Yarn will: Install all dependencies for both TerriaMap and any packages in your packages directory. Install the devDependencies for packages in the packages directory so you can actually develop on them. Create sym-links so that everything works. De-duplicate semver-compatible packages and bubble them up to the root node_modules directory. Now, we can edit TerriaJS in packages/terriajs with the benefit of a full-featured git repo. Confirm that yarn has configured TerriaMap to use the copy of TerriaJS in packages/terriajs by verifying that node_modules/terriajs is a symlink to packages/terriajs . If it's not, you probably have a version conflict. See the note above. Note Running yarn install with workspaces configured will change yarn.lock . Please do not commit the changes. To switch TerriaMap back to using the npm version of TerriaJS (instead of the git repo), do: # warning: make sure you don't need any of your changes to TerriaJS first! rm -rf packages/terriajs yarn install Committing modifications If you make changes to TerriaJS and TerriaMap together, here's the process for getting them to production. First, commit your TerriaJS changes to a branch and open a pull request to merge that branch to master. Simultaneously, you may want to make a branch of TerriaMap that uses your modified version of TerriaJS. To do that, modify TerriaMap's package.json . Where it has a line like: \"terriajs\": \"^4.5.0\", Change it to: \"terriajs\": \"git://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs.git#branchName\", Replace branchName with the name of the TerriaJS branch you want to use. You may even use a repository other than TerriaJS/terriajs if your branch is in a fork of TerriaJS instead of in the official repository. Once your TerriaJS pull request has been merged and a new version of the terriajs npm module has been published, please remember to update package.json to point to an official terriajs version instead of a branch in a GitHub repo. The package.json in the master branch of TerriaMap should point to official releases of terriajs on npm, NOT GitHub branches. In other words, it is ok to commit a package.json with a git URL to a branch, but do not merge it to master. Documentation Documentation is automatically generated from the source via JSDoc (reference) and MkDocs (user guide) by running: npm run gulp docs It will be placed in the wwwroot/doc folder. You need a standalone install of MkDocs and the mkdocs-material theme in order to build the user guide. Install these by running: pip install -r doc/requirements.txt Tests / Specs We use Jasmine for the TerriaJS tests, called specs in Jasmine parlance. To run the specs, you first need to build them by running this in the TerriaJS (not TerriaMap!) directory: npm run gulp And start the development web server by running (also from the TerriaJS and not TerriaMap! directory): npm start The test suite is run by opening a web browser on http://localhost:3002/SpecRunner.html . The source code for the specs is found in the test/ directory. TerriaJS Gulp Tasks Run any of these tasks with npm run gulp <task name> from within the TerriaJS directory: default - Invoked by running gulp without any arguments, this task invokes the build and lint tasks. build - Builds a non-minified version of the TerriaJS tests. This task may take 10 seconds or more, which is the main reason for the next task. watch - Starts the same as build but then it stays running and watches for changes to any TerriaJS or Cesium source file that was pulled in to the build. When a change to any of these files is detected, a fast incremental build is automatically kicked off. The incremental build is much faster than the full rebuild because dependencies between source files are cached. release - The same as build except that it also minifies the build tests. lint - Runs ESLint on the files in the lib folder and reports any problems. The ESLint rules are defined in the .eslintrc file in the root directory of TerriaJS. A stricter set of rules is also find in the .eslintrc file in lib/ReactViews . docs - Generates the user guide and reference documentation. The user guide is served at http://localhost:3002/doc/guide/ and the reference documentation is at http://localhost:3002/doc/reference/ . make-schema - Generates JSON Schema for the TerriaJS Initialization Files from the source code. The schema is written to wwwroot/schema . test - Detects browsers available on the local system and launches the test suite in each. The results are reported on the command line. test-electron - Runs the tests in Electron, a headless (no UI) Chrome-like browser. test-saucelabs - Runs the tests on a bunch of browsers on Sauce Labs . You will need to Set up Sauce Labs . test-browserstack - Runs the tests on a bunch of browsers on BrowserStack . You will need to set up a BrowserStack account. See gulpfile.js for more gulp tasks. TerriaMap Gulp Tasks Run any of these tasks with npm run gulp <task name> from within the TerriaMap directory: default - Invoked by running gulp without any arguments, this task invokes the build and lint tasks. build - Builds a non-minified version of TerriaMap, TerriaJS, Cesium, and all other dependencies, together in one JS file (called wwwroot/build/TerriaMap.js ). Only the parts of TerriaJS and Cesium that we use (directly or indirectly) are pulled in. Web Workers, CSS, and other resources are also built by this task.

This task should be used when building for production. lint - Runs ESLint on index.js and the files in the lib folder and reports any problems. The ESLint rules are defined in the .eslintrc file in the root directory of TerriaMap. make-package - Creates a .tar.gz package in deploy/packages from the current build. This package can be copied to another machine to run the application there. The arguments are: Argument Description --packageName <name> The name of the package. If not specified, the name is <npm_package_name>-<git_describe> , where <npm_package_name> is the value of the npm_package_name environment variable and <git_describe> is the output of running git describe .

In a default TerriaMap installation, the main init file is found in wwwroot/init/terria.json . An init file is a JSON file with this basic structure: { \"catalog\": [ { \"type\": \"group\", \"name\": \"My group\", \"items\": [ ... ] }, ... ], \"homeCamera\": { \"north\": -8, \"east\": 158, \"south\": -45, \"west\": 109 }, \"initialCamera\": { ... }, \"corsDomains\": [ \"myserver.gov.au\" ] } Key points: catalog is an array. Every element of that array must have a type (corresponding to a value recognised by TerriaJS) and a name . The three major categories of catalog member types are: Catalog Group : A group (folder) of items. Different group types allow the contents to be manually specified or to be automatically determined by querying various types of server. Catalog Item : Actual geospatial or chart data from a file or service, in various formats. Catalog Function : A parameterized service, such as a Web Processing Service (WPS). The user supplies the parameters and gets back some result. Most of the other properties of each layer depend on the specific type. See the links above for details of each type. Using a catalog file There are four ways to load a catalog file into a TerriaJS application: Store it in Terria Map's wwwroot/init directory, and refer to it in the initializationUrls section of the config.json file. It is loaded automatically when you visit the webpage. This is how wwwroot/init/terria.json is loaded in the default TerriaMap setup. Store it in Terria Maps's wwwroot/init directory, without adding it to config.json. Add the catalog file name (without .json ) to the URL after # . For instance, example.com/terria#mycatalog . See Controlling with URL Parameters for more information. This method is useful when developing a catalog that is not quite ready for public access, but it is helpful to show it to interested stakeholders. Store it anywhere on the web (on a CORS-enabled server). Add the complete URL (including .json ) to the URL, after # . For instance, http://nationalmap.gov.au/#http://example.com/mycatalog.json . This method is useful when developing services for a TerriaJS instance which you don't directly control, and for rapidly previewing changes which you can also share with people. Store it locally, then drag and drop it into the Terria Map window. All catalog files, however loaded, are merged together in TerriaJS. Any two items with the same name and place in the tree are combined. This means that if two catalog files each define a group called \"Water\", there will be only one \"Water\" group in Terria, containing the two sets of group members merged together. Editing catalog files Catalog files can be edited three ways: Using a desktop text editor. Be very careful to ensure that your file is valid JSON. This is more restrictive format than simple JavaScript, for instance. You can use http://jsonlint.com/ . Using a JSON-specific editor, such as http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/ . This has the advantage that your file will be valid JSON. Using the TerriaJS Catalog Editor, currently available in a preview version at http://terria.io/DataSourceEditor/ . This editor is not yet considered reliable, and may cause data corruption. Catalog file properties corsDomains By default, TerriaJS proxies all requests within the proxy whitelist specified in the Server-side Config , making the assumption that the servers do not support CORS. You can add hosts that are known to support CORS to this property to avoid proxying them. \"corsDomains\": [ \"myserver.gov.au\" ] See Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for more information. homeCamera and initialCamera Maps have two camera positions, homeCamera and initialCamera . They are specified identically. All the examples here use homeCamera , but apply equally to both. initialCamera : the location when the map first displays homeCamera : where the camera goes when you click the \"home\" button between the zoom-in and zoom-out buttons. Option 1: north , south , east , west The bounding box method uses north , east , south , and west , in lat/lng decimal degrees. The camera will be positioned in the center point of those bounds, looking toward the Earth's center, zoomed back enough to see to the edges of the bounds. This is the only mode supported in 2D mode (Leaflet). Therefore, you should always include a bounding box, even if you also use another mode. \"homeCamera\": { \"north\": -8, \"east\": 158, \"south\": -45, \"west\": 109 } Option 2: position , direction and up This overrides Option 1. You can specify position , direction , and up (as well as north , east , south , and west ). position , direction and up need x , y and z keys specifying locations in ECEF metre coordinates, which means the origin is the centre of the Earth, positive Z points to the north pole, positive X points toward \"Null Island\" where the equator intersects with 0 degrees longitude, and positive Y points at (0, 90E) -- which is in the Indian Ocean south of the Bay of Bengal. position : where the camera is direction : where the camera is looking up : which way is \"up\", which determines how the camera is rotated For most purposes positioning this way is difficult for normal humans.

First, you may want to build a minified version of TerriaMap by running: npm run gulp release The normal build ( npm run gulp ) can be deployed as well, but the release version is smaller and faster. Then, you can host your TerriaMap using either the included Node.js-based web server, or by using any web server of your choosing. Using the included Node.js-based web server The easiest way to deploy your TerriaMap is to use the included Node.js-based web server, called terriajs-server . You'll need Node.js 8.0+ installed on the server in order to run terriajs-server. Then, copy the following files and directories from your local system where you built TerriaMap onto the server: wwwroot node_modules devserverconfig.json And on the server, change to the directory where you copied those files and directories and run: ./node_modules/.bin/pm2 start ecosystem-production.config.js --update-env --env production The server will start on port 3001. You can specify a different port by adding --port 1234 to the command-line above. It is usually a good idea to run another web server, such as nginx or Varnish on port 80 and then reverse-proxy to the Node.js server, rather than running terriajs-server on port 80 directly. You will find a varnish VCL file with the TerriaMap source code in the deploy/varnish directory . In addition to acting as a reverse proxy for the Node.js server, the supplied Varnish configuration also caches requests to proxied map data in order to improve performance. Using any web server terriajs-server , described above, only does a few things: It serves up the static HTML, JavaScript, and CSS that make up the application. It includes a simple service at /proxy that allows TerriaJS to access geospatial data servers that don't support CORS . If this service is not available, TerriaJS won't be able to access any datasets that are on other servers and that don't support CORS. It includes another service at /convert that uses GDAL and OGR to transform otherwise unsupported geospatial vector data (e.g. shapefiles) to GeoJSON for display by the TerriaJS client. If this service is not available, these data formats will not be supported. However, all the formats that TerriaJS supports directly will work just fine. When configured correctly, it persists blobs of JSON for use in the sharing feature. If this service is not available, the JSON can be stored in the share URL, instead. However, this makes for some extremely long URLs. If these limitations are acceptable, you can run your TerriaMap on virtually any web server by simply copying the TerriaMap wwwroot onto the server!

Prerequisites awscli Deploying requires a recent version of awscli . It's recommended to install and maintain this using pip as the Homebrew and Ubuntu packages are quite old. pip install awscli AWS credentials You must have an awscli configuration profile (in ~/.aws/config ) with a name that matches awsProfile in package.json . e.g. [profile terria] aws_access_key_id=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY aws_secret_access_key=YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY package.json Various parameters controlling AWS deployment are specified in package.json . They are: awsProfile - The AWS profile to use (see AWS credentials above) when interacting with AWS. awsS3PackagesPath - The S3 path to which to copy the deployment .tar.gz. awsRegion - The AWS region in which to create resources. awsEc2InstanceType - The type of EC2 instance to use. awsEc2ImageId - The ID of the EC2 image to use. awsKeyName - The name of a key that may be used to SSH to the EC2 instance. awsS3ServerConfigOverridePath - The path to a file on S3 containing any overrides to devserverconfig.json . awsS3ClientConfigOverridePath - The path to a file on S3 containing any overrides to wwwroot/config.json . You can customize these settings by changing package.json , or by using npm config to override the setting locally, for example; npm config set terriajs-map:awsProfile myprofilename stack.json You will need to modify deploy/aws/stack.json to match your environment. In particular, you will need to change: Parameters.HostedZoneName.Default : This is the domain name where a DNS record for the deployment will be created. SSLCertificateId in Resources.ElasticLoadBalancer.Listeners : The SSL certificate to use for HTTPS connections to the deployment. If you don't have a certificate or don't want to support HTTPS, remove the entire listener with \"LoadBalancerPort\": \"443\" . terriamap-sharing in Resources.S3Role.Properties.Policies.PolicyDocument.Statement : This authorizes the EC2 instances to access an S3 bucket to be used to store JSON blobs for the sharing feature. You will want to create a bucket for this purpose and add its name here. Deploy Prior to deploying, please tag the release, e.g. git tag -a 2016-05-17 -m '2016-05-17 release' git push origin 2016-05-17 Deployment is initiated via npm scripts. A full production deployment may be initiated with: npm run deploy Once the stack starts up, it will be available at terriajs-map-2016-05-17.terria.io , where terriajs-map is the name of the project in package.json and 2016-05-17 is the output of git describe (that's why you should tag before starting a deployment). The following npm scripts are available: deploy - Removes the node_modules directory, runs npm install , and launches the deploy-without-reinstall script. deploy-without-reinstall - Runs gulp clean (which removes the wwwroot/build directory) and gulp release , and then launches the deploy-current script. deploy-current - Gets the two configuration override files specified in package.json from S3, builds a package (.tar.gz), uploads it to S3, and spins up a CloudFormation stack.

For example to create a geoserver called my_new_geoserver use the commands below. sudo cp geoserver.war /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/my_new_geoserver.war sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat8 restart You should now be able to see a geoserver running at http://localhost:8080/my_new_geoserver/ . The geoserver will contain the example datasets that ship with Geoserver. Geoserver has good documentation available here to get you going on entering your data into your server instance. Caching Tiles In order for your server to perform effectively we highly recommend that you cache the tile requests from National Map. There are 2 primary ways to do this - either turning on the GeoWebCache that comes with Geoserver or running a proxy server in front of your geoserver. The easiest solution is to just use the GeoWebCache service. The documentation for GeoWebCache is here . Mainly it consists of turning on direct integration in the caching defaults and making sure that your layers have caching turned on. You may also want to control the caching folder which can be done by editing your geoserver instance as explained here . You will also probably need to set permissions in your new cache folder to 666. The other solution is to put a caching proxy in front of your geoserver instance. This also has the benefit of being able to access your server on port 80 if you wish. The two primary options we have worked with are nginx and varnish . These are both available as packages on ubuntu. Below is an example of setting up nginx to work with geoserver. nginx sudo apt-get install -y nginx Then modify the configuration files to point to your server and turn on caching sudo /etc/init.d/nginx stop sudo cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.orig sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and add this line at the bottom of the http section proxy_cache_path /your/cache/folder/ keys_zone=one:10m max_size=8G; sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default.orig sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default in the servers section, comment out the root and index lines and add this line right after proxy_cache one; and replace the location setting in the server section with the following code (replacing my_new_geoserver with your server name) location /my_new_geoserver/ { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/; proxy_next_upstream error timeout invalid_header http_500 http_502 http_503 http_504; proxy_redirect off; proxy_buffering off; proxy_set_header Host $http_host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; } Now restart sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start And if all went as planned you should be able to access your server at http://localhost/my_new_geoserver/web. Allowing National Map to access your server Due to security in modern browsers, for National Map to use your service you will probably need to do a little more work. Either you will need to set up your server with CORS support or provide a proxy service for your geoserver to allow National Map access to your data. National Map includes a proxy to some domains by default and if you are in these domains we will provide the proxy service. If you are not in these domains, you will get an cross-domain-access error. To work with National Map without using a proxy, Geoserver must be configured to support CORS . The most common way to do this is to install CORS Filter . An alternative approach, is to add CORS support to your nginx or varnish proxy service. See the documentation on how to do this. Thanks to the AREMI team, adding the necessary CORS headers with a Varnish reverse-proxy in front of the Geoserver can be done by adding the following to /etc/varnish/default.vcl : sub vcl_fetch { set beresp.http.Access-Control-Allow-Origin = \"*\"; set beresp.http.Access-Control-Allow-Credentials = \"true\"; } Moving your Geoserver Instance Moving your geoserver instance to a new location is pretty straightforward. The .war file that a geoserver instance comes in is just a special layout of a .zip file. So the following commands can be used to create a .war file that you can then add to a tomcat instance on another server. sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat8 stop sudo mv /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/my_new_geoserver . cd my_new_geoserver zip -r my_new_geoserver.war * sudo mv my_new_geoserver /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat8 start once it's uploaded to the new site you can add the geoserver with: sudo cp my_new_geoserver.war /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/my_new_geoserver.war sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat8 restart Running your Geoserver on AWS Running a geoserver on a standard EC2 instance requires a little tuning to take advantage of the instance storage volume properly. First go ahead and create your instance (we use a standard m3.large instance with port 80 opened) and install java and tomcat as explained above. Now package up your geoserver as described in the previous section and copy it up to your EC2 instance and ssh in once it's copied. scp -i geoserver-instance.pem my_new_geoserver.war ubuntu@xx.xx.xx.xx:/home/ubuntu ssh -i geoserver-instance.pem ubuntu@xx.xx.xx.xx From the shell the first thing you need to do is move the webapps folder in tomcat to the instance storage. sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat8 stop sudo cp -rf /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps.orig sudo mv /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/ /mnt sudo ln -s /mnt/webapps /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps and copy your uploaded geoserver sudo cp *.war /mnt/webapps and then restart sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat8 start sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart If you are using geowebcache or a caching proxy you will need to change the caching dir as referenced above to also be on the /mnt drive to avoid running out of space on the EC2 boot drive. NOTE: If the instance is stopped you will need to go through these step again when you start, since the instance storage is wiped clean in this case.
